# AleBot

A small project that I made so I could get a grasp around the basics of programming.

It's a huge mess so expect to find issues and problems everywhere.

I'd really appreciate if you have any tips or things you think are worth adding or changing.

## Requirements

As mentioned above the current code is a mess so there are some things to do for the bot to function 100% as expected.

First, Python requirements:

1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. discord.py 2.1.0
3. `asyncio`, `catapi.py`, `requests`, `Pybooru` (the command using this is disabled by default and will probably get deleted soon)

Next, files the bot expects to exist (next to main.py):

1. `token.txt` - Discord bot token. This is the only required file for basic functionality.
2. `catapi.txt` - API key from [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/).
3. `frisk.txt` - List of links separated by newlines that is called when running "ale!frisk".
4. `gilbert.txt` - List of links separated by newlines that is called when running "ale!gilbold".
5. `Gilberts.json` - JSON file containing links and name aliases used by "ale!gilbert", formatted roughly as follows:
```
{
    "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/934379530729164810/934379708601237534/Ale.png": [
        "Ale"
    ],
    "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/934379530729164810/934379935424974918/Trevor.png": [
        "Trevor",
        "TCAtrevor"
    ]
}
```
6. `scores.json` & `tries.json` - JSON files read from and written to by the "ale!gilbert" command and the "ale!scoreboard" subcommands.
9. `adminList.json` - JSON file containing the IDs of the users that can use privileged commands.
7. `REDDIT.png` - Just an image file uploaded to Discord when calling "ale!REDDIT".
8. `mokou/` - A folder with 700 images named `1.jpg` to `700.jpg`. The intended images for this folder can be found [here](https://twitter.com/jokanhiyou/status/1556186890428039168).

Some commands run under bash so on Windows you will need Windows Subsystem for Linux for them to work (the bot runs outside of the subsystem and will only call it when needed). With bash you should only need to install `neofetch` using a package manager.
